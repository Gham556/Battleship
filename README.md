# Battleship

The goal of this project is to create a working game of Batlleship that utilizes unit testing to ensure that all functions are working during development. 

In making this I have found unit testing to be extremely helpful, although clunky and cumbersome at times. The time I spent working out my base functions was cut way down, and subsequently most of my time was spent manipulating DOM elements (and I will improve this as I move on to learning React).

As of now the script can run a functional game of Battleship and decide a winner. It allows players to drag and drop ships for placement, and changes CSS elements accordingly. It also has a computer player which will randomly attack a square on the players board without repeating. 

The page is missing a lot of polish. The CSS looks atroshish, and there is no hard end to the game besides a log statment. There is also nothing to prevent a player from clicking the same square multiple times, no actual UI, no way to manipulate the direction of the ships, and allows infinte placing of ships. 

I am aware of all of these issues and am confident in my ability to fix them, so to best use my time I am going to table this projects much needed polish while I learn React.
